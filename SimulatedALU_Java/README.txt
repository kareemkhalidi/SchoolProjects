Arithmetic Logic Unit simulated in java created by Kareem Khalidi for CSC 252 "Computer Organization" at the University of Arizona.

Usage: functions like a real computer ALU. "ALUTest.java" shows how the ALU can be used to perform addition (ALUOp 2). The ALU can also be used
       to perform a bitwise AND with ALUOp 0, a bitwise OR with ALUOp 1, subtraction by keeping ALUOp at 2 but changing BNegate to 1, and a
       bitwise XOR with ALUOp 4. It can also perform comparison of two numbers (ex: a < b) using ALUOp 3.
