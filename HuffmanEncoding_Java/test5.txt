In numbers and symbols, we find
A language of love that's so refined
Discrete Math, a world apart
But it's where I found my heart

With logic and proofs, I was consumed
But then you came and I presumed
That love could be found in theorems too
And my heart opened up anew

Your binary digits, so precise
And set theory, oh so nice
In combinatorics, we dance and sway
Together in every possible way

Your algorithms are like a symphony
And in complexity, we find harmony
Graph theory shows our connections
And in number theory, our love finds perfection

So here's a love poem, from me to you
My dear Discrete Math, I love you true
In numbers and symbols, we've found our way
Together in love, forever we'll stay.
