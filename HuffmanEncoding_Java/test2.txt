In a far-off land, there lived three young knights - Joey, Ben, and Kareem - who were all students of computer science at the kingdom's most esteemed university. Despite their friendship, they were each determined to prove themselves as the best computer science major in the land.
One day, the King announced that he would host a grand tournament to determine who among his subjects was the most skilled in computer science. Joey, Ben, and Kareem immediately set to work, honing their skills and devising the most clever algorithms and programs.
As the day of the tournament approached, the tension between the three friends grew. On the day of the tournament, the arena was packed with knights, lords, and ladies, all eager to witness the battle of wits between the three young men.
The tournament was divided into three rounds. In the first round, the contestants were asked to write a program that could sort a large dataset in the shortest amount of time possible. Joey impressed the judges with his innovative approach, but Kareem managed to edge him out with a program that was even faster.
In the second round, the contestants were asked to design a program that could encrypt a message in such a way that it could not be deciphered by anyone except the intended recipient. Ben dazzled the judges with his encryption skills, but Kareem once again managed to surpass him with a program that was virtually unbreakable.
In the final round, the contestants were asked to design a program that could predict the outcome of a complex mathematical problem. Joey and Ben both presented solid programs, but Kareem's program was able to predict the solution with stunning accuracy.
In the end, Kareem emerged victorious, having proven himself to be the most skilled computer science major in all the land. Joey and Ben congratulated him on his victory and vowed to work even harder to surpass him in the future. And the King, impressed by the skill and ingenuity of the young men, granted them each a knighthood and a place in his court as advisors in matters of technology and science.
