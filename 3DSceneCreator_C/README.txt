3d scene creator created by Kareem Khalidi for CSC 352 Systems Programming and UNIX at the University of Arizona.

Usage: follow the format in "3dTest.c" to add various pyramids and cuboids and create an output stl file. Then use an
       online STL viewer, such as https://www.viewstl.com/ to view your 3d scene. OR just run "3dTest.c" as is and
       then view the simple scene I put together.
