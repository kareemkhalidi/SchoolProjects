20 questions game created by Kareem Khalidi for CSC 352 "Systems Programming and UNIX" at the University of Arizona.

Usage: run "game.c" with "test.txt" as the argument. If you want to add questions or answers, follow the format of
       "test.txt" to create your own questions and answers. The first line is the number of answers, the second is 
       a comma delimited list of all the questions, and the rest of the lines are the answers followed by their
       answers to the questions.
